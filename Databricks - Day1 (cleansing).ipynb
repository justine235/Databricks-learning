Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags. Some of the businesses that braved the less-than-savory days are still around, such as the Hayes Street Grill, now twice its original size. But many of the shops sprouted up in the '90s, making Hayes Valley a real destination spot. The combination results in a wide diversity in clientele.

Our cleaning providers have doubled their rates, due to Airbnb's Covid Cleaning Protocals (which we endorse). <br /><br />Welcome to our spacious guest suite with private bathroom on sunny Potrero Hill! It is on the lower level of our house and looks out on a quiet garden. <br /><br />Please note that there is NO SMOKING (this includes electronic cigarettes) in the house, the garden or in front of the house.<br /><br />FUN FACT: Science-fiction writer Frank Herbert lived in this house in the 1960s, and wrote most of his acclaimed book \"Dune\" while living here! <br /><br />Features include:<br /><br />--King-size bed, ","Potrero Hill is the sunniest neighborhood in San Francisco! In the summertime, when much of the city is covered in chilly fog, our neighborhood usually has sunshine. We are walking distance from the new Chase Center (home to major music performances and Golden State Warriors basketball) and about a mile from Oracle Park (home to  Giants baseball) The neighborhood has great views and it's very quiet but, yet, you can quickly get downtown or to the trendy (but rowdy) Mission District. We have an assortment of great local restaurants within walking distance (we provide restaurant menus and a map), and you can even organize a tour of San Francisco's most famous historic brewery, Anchor Steam, which is a few blocks away. There are 2 markets and a great little organic grocery store within an easy walk. We have a wonderful bookstore, independent coffee houses and cute shops on the main business street in the neighborhood. See photos of them in the photo section of our listing.","https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/187496/07754eb5_original.jpg","106005","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/106005","Gayle","2010-04-09","San Francisco, California, United States","BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I ARE FULLY VACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19.

boutiques, clubs, bars, movie theaters, Civic Center, the Symphony & Opera and much more. One block away from a beautiful park where kids can play safely, two blocks away from BART / Muni transportation system and street cars. The access to the highway and the airport is very easy and very convenient.<br /><br />This very large flat is fully furnished. It has its own entrance and comes with a parking space. The living room has a large bay window w</td><td>Neighborhood: HAYES VALLEY. This San Francisco vacation rental is located in the heart of Hayes Valley. Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags. Some of the businesses that braved the less-than-savory days are still around, such as the Hayes Street Grill, now twice its original size. But many of the shops sprouted up in the '90s, making Hayes Valley a real destination spot. The combination results in a wide diversity in clientele. While high-end San Franciscans sip $7 cocktails at Absinthe, down the street many are powering down an entire meal for around the same price at Flipper's.<br /><br />Now, tourists also head here specifically for the shopping, for one-of-a-kinds like a buffalo-leather chair or an exclusive Sue Wong Art Deco gown.<br /><br />The Hayes Valley commercial sector is young in age, but adult in style.

There are a variety of really good restaurants, from our authentic French bistro, Le P'tit Laurent, American fare at Chenery Park, Gialina Pizzeria, La Corneta Taqueria, Eco Sushi, and Osha Thai restaurant. <br /><br />For breakfast, try Destination Bakery for fresh brioche, Tyger's Coffee Shop, or my favorite, Higher Grounds, where they serve amazing crepes.  <br /><br />The village has a great independent bookstore, the Bird & Beckett, and there’s live jazz on Friday and Sunday nights.  <br /><br />There’s a terrific gourmet supermarket, Canyon Market (see photos).  Finally, the Village has its very own Farmer's Market on Sundays, selling local produce from farms all over the Bay Area.
